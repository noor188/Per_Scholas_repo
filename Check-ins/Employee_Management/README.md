# Employee-Managment
Extending the Employee Class with SalaryEmp and HourlyEmp

# Goal
In this lab, I extended the existing Employee class to include two
subclasses, SalaryEmp and HourlyEmp. Each subclass implements a
unique calculation and display method. I added a method to the
Employee class, inputEmployee(); this method prompts the
administrator to input employee details.
